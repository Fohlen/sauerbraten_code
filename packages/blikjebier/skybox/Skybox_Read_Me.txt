Additional notes:

This is my first skybox, the setting is at the bottom of the seafloor, yes you can also do that with Terragen, just add a lot of blue mist and power down the sun (ie, less strenght).

As Makke wrote on Quadrapolis, use these settings.

skybox_ft -- pitch = 0, head = 0
skybox_lf -- pitch = 0, head = 90
skybox_bk -- pitch = 0, head = 180
skybox_rt -- pitch = 0, head = 270
skybox_dn -- pitch = -90, head = 270
skybox_up -- pitch = 90, head = 270

And set your magnification setting to "1".

You can use ACDSee for the conversion from BMP to JPG, mind you to set the quality the highest level, otherwise you will get artefacts on your skybox, and those made by ACDSee are gross.
