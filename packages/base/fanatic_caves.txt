---------------------------
Important!
---------------------------

Fix the blocking on curvey chains before running the game, and read more below for details on the map itself.

Modify your local file for the curve chain models to make them non-blocking:

[Sauerbraten install]\packages\models\tentus\chains\md2.cfg

...from:

mdlspec 100

...to:

mdlspec 100
mdlcollide 0

That will make the curve chain non-blocking. This is currently fixed in the CVS version, but not the current public release.

If you don't change it, you will have to jump over the bounding box of the curve chain in several areas, and won't be able to get past a few other areas.

Description
---------------------------

I started this map about a month or two ago after watching the Blade movies back to back one weekend.

The general idea is you wake up in a small town, everything looks like it was recently in use, but no one can be found.

You wander around and find deep down in the caves an underground vampire "castle", and they must have just fed and are back in their coffins.

This map was not intended to run fast or with high FPS. It was designed to look "pretty". As such, I didn't add any weapons or ammo, no health or pickups.

Think of it as a demo map to see what the engine can do and how well (or poorly) your system can run it.

I added some custom sounds for wind and water effects, nothing fancy, and a custom song I wrote for the map that plays in a loop.

Load it up, wander around, and enjoy.

If you get stuck on any stairs or a non-flat surface, press E twice and you will bounce out of it. It looks like the engine doesn't handle some weird angles well and the player gets stuck.

---------------------------
Loading This Map (Windows)
---------------------------

Unzip all the files in this zip file in your Sauerbraten/packages/ folder with directory structure.

It will unzip the main map files in packages/base and the sound files in packages/sounds/fanatic/

To load this map, open a DOS prompt, change to your Sauerbraten directory (where your sauerbraten.bat file is located) and type:

sauerbraten.bat -lfanatic_caves -w[width] -h[height]

I have a descent system, so I use this:

sauerbraten.bat -lfanatic_caves -w1600 -h1200

You can use a lower resolution to get better framerates, for example:

sauerbraten.bat -lfanatic_caves -w1024 -h768
sauerbraten.bat -lfanatic_caves -w800 -h600
sauerbraten.bat -lfanatic_caves -w640 -h480

Try different resolutions to find what works best with your system.
